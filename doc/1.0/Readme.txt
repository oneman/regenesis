etc, your  choice ;)
We describe here a computational resynthesis engine via a concrete implementation description in
that like Motizuki’s IUT is a whole bunch of simple stuff hooked up just certainly wright right rite.
Well what we do with this engine is construct a special kind of cyber reasoning system that is not
retarded like anything else before it called a cyber reasoning system as this one is actually totally 
and completely absolutely utterly truly based and thus not confusable with any kind of bravo sierra.
In that it is totally a quantum information processing system if anything is, quantum just meaning
counting, and in the case of reasoning we understand that to mean uh always considering and tracking
the true and correct and incorrect and mispercieved reasons that things happen in order to put everything
in the appropriate proper visual or other context but always inevidably that is pix or didn’t happen, we
could say have a kind of CPU which has an instruction pointer and stack pointer and all the other usual 
stuff anything that exists and works would be fine but we add to that a reason pointer for the instruction that
is tracable up to user action or some other thing that is in a modular system of systems ring synthesisor or modulator
or whatever but we can put all legacy systems ever into the loop including the jaccard loom to the eniac and the pdp-11
and ibm system 7 and unix system any of them linux is infact a wonderbase we are init and or a module that is a local
superuser to that system and we map a memory size of 4205260800 bytes that we are able to view as rgb24 pixels in an
two dimensional array of 26 by 26 1080p screenshots or png or 676 1080p frames or 169 4k superframes or something.
We observe the following: 1,026,675 * 4096 = 4205260800 ok so our computer lives on a rgb framebuffer substrace ya.
Of course we may consider part of it or all of it or any parallel or serial network of this computer system substrate as
any other kind of buffer maybe a 1 bit pixel buffer of any size or maybe a unicode or ascii or binary encoding of any
kind but of course we can imagine constructing and will construct systems that convert from one thing to the next
like usual but we make this in a new way using multiradial reconstruction algorithms like that of IUT and in the same
way confuse everyone to death, so lets just say this is some kind Steam Game we are working on but we can’t afford a
Steam developer whatever it is yet hahah, click here to save the world, lol ok.
