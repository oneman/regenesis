<^Gecko^> dick van dyke will be 100 on dec 13th
<scanline> The topic message is wrong. We are not all here from the YT episode, I found this channel browsing randomly.
<^Gecko^> oh?
<scanline> yep
<scanline> The state of IRC is pretty bad in general, though... there are very few networks with anything still going on.
<^Gecko^> well, it's funny because some of us were like 'oh he made an irc channel' and we looked carefully at the video and joined this channel and it kind of just started like that
<^Gecko^> lol
<scanline> interesting
<scanline> If more of that kind of thing happened maybe IRC *could* really make a comeback
<oneman> its going to blow up
<oneman> gabillions of bytes
<^Gecko^> Irc is like the scene from The Sandlot;  heroes live forever, but legends never die.   
<^Gecko^> IRC is legend, lol
<scanline> IRC is real life!
<^Gecko^> we don't face the hardships of networks like discord.
<scanline> I don't use Discord but from what I understand it's pretty obnoxious.
<^Gecko^> you want to set up a network, it's as easy as downloading unrealircd
<^Gecko^> it's 'fine' but it can be annoying
<^Gecko^> there's paid features that they like to advertise for
<^Gecko^> i like the embedded media/links aspect
<scanline> Yeah, I guess.
